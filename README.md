ComputerNetworks
================

Repository for Olin Computer Networks Course. Here's a little tidbit summary of what we did...

Using Raspberry Pi computers and Python, each team in the class built their own LAN and sent messages across a common bus in Morse Code. From the physical layer to the application layer, we built a realistic model of the internet and incorporated MAC, IP, and UDP headers in our transmissions. Once we had completed our LANs, we convened as a standards body and developed a IP and UDP class standard to allow communication with the other LANs. We presented our Python powered internet at PyCon 2014.
